      <p>Edge computing represents a fundamental shift in how we architect and deploy applications. Instead of routing all requests through centralized data centers, edge computing brings computation closer to users—often within milliseconds of their physical location.</p>

      <h2>Why Edge Computing Matters</h2>
      <p>The traditional model of cloud computing served us well, but it has inherent limitations. When a user in Sydney needs to fetch data from a server in Virginia, physics becomes the enemy. Light can only travel so fast, and each network hop adds latency.</p>

      <p>Edge computing addresses this by distributing application logic across a global network of points of presence (PoPs). Platforms like Cloudflare Workers run code in over 300 cities worldwide, ensuring that most requests are served from a location within 50 milliseconds of the user.</p>

      <h2>Real-World Applications</h2>
      <p>We're seeing edge computing transform several key areas:</p>

      <p><strong>Personalization at Scale</strong> — A/B tests, feature flags, and personalized content can be computed at the edge without round-trips to origin servers. This means personalized experiences with no performance penalty.</p>

      <p><strong>Authentication and Authorization</strong> — Validating tokens and enforcing access policies at the edge reduces load on your core infrastructure and speeds up security checks.</p>

      <p><strong>Content Transformation</strong> — Resizing images, converting formats, and optimizing assets on-the-fly based on device capabilities and network conditions.</p>

      <p><strong>API Gateways</strong> — Rate limiting, request validation, and response caching closer to users improves both security and performance.</p>

      <h2>Architectural Considerations</h2>
      <p>Moving to the edge isn't without challenges. Edge environments have constraints—limited memory, ephemeral execution contexts, and restrictions on certain APIs. You need to design your applications with these limitations in mind.</p>

      <p>State management is particularly important. Edge functions are typically stateless, so you need strategies for handling persistent data. Solutions like Durable Objects provide consistency guarantees while maintaining edge performance.</p>

      <h2>Getting Started</h2>
      <p>If you're exploring edge computing, start small. Identify a specific use case—perhaps static site hosting, API routing, or authentication—and experiment with moving that functionality to the edge. The learning curve is manageable, and the performance gains are often immediate and significant.</p>

      <p>The future of application architecture is distributed. Edge computing is becoming essential infrastructure for any team serious about performance and user experience.</p>
