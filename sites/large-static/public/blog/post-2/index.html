      <p>A well-implemented design system is one of the highest-leverage investments a product organization can make. It accelerates development, ensures consistency, and creates a shared language between designers and engineers. But building one that actually works at scale is harder than it looks.</p>

      <h2>More Than a Component Library</h2>
      <p>Many teams confuse a design system with a component library. While components are essential, a true design system encompasses much more: design tokens, documentation, governance processes, and the principles that guide decision-making.</p>

      <p>Components are the what. The design system explains the why and how.</p>

      <h2>Start with Foundations</h2>
      <p>Before building a single component, establish your design tokens: color palettes, typography scales, spacing systems, and motion timing. These foundational decisions ripple through every component you'll build.</p>

      <p>Design tokens should be:</p>
      <ul style="padding-left: 1.5rem; margin: 1rem 0;">
        <li>Platform-agnostic in definition</li>
        <li>Easily exportable to multiple formats (CSS, JSON, iOS, Android)</li>
        <li>Semantically named (use "color-text-primary" not "gray-900")</li>
        <li>Versioned and documented</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Governance Challenge</h2>
      <p>Technical implementation is the easy part. The hard part is organizational: getting teams to adopt the system, handling requests for variations, and evolving the system without breaking existing implementations.</p>

      <p>Successful design systems need:</p>
      <p><strong>Clear Ownership</strong> — Someone (or some team) must be accountable for the system's health and evolution. Without ownership, systems stagnate or fragment.</p>

      <p><strong>Contribution Guidelines</strong> — Define how teams can propose changes, what review process new components undergo, and how breaking changes are communicated.</p>

      <p><strong>Support Channels</strong> — Teams using the system need ways to ask questions, report bugs, and request features. Slack channels, office hours, and good documentation all help.</p>

      <h2>Documentation That Works</h2>
      <p>The best design system documentation is interactive and example-driven. Show components in context, provide copy-paste code snippets, and explain not just what components do, but when to use them.</p>

      <p>Tools like Storybook excel here, offering live component playgrounds alongside documentation. Designers and developers can explore variations, test edge cases, and understand component behavior without digging through source code.</p>

      <h2>Measuring Success</h2>
      <p>How do you know if your design system is working? Track metrics like:</p>
      <ul style="padding-left: 1.5rem; margin: 1rem 0;">
        <li>Adoption rate across teams and products</li>
        <li>Time to implement common patterns</li>
        <li>Design-to-development handoff efficiency</li>
        <li>Consistency scores in UI audits</li>
        <li>Contribution volume from consuming teams</li>
      </ul>

      <p>A thriving design system becomes infrastructure that teams rely on and contribute to. Getting there takes patience, iteration, and genuine investment in the experience of the system's users—your fellow designers and developers.</p>
